Description: Coherence is a framework written in Python,
        providing a variety of UPnP MediaServer and UPnP MediaRenderer implementations
        for instant use. It includes an UPnP ControlPoint, which is accessible via
        D-Bus too. Furthermore it enables your application to participate in
        digital living networks, at the moment primarily the DLNA/UPnP universe.
        
        Its objective and demand is to relieve your application from all the
        membership/the UPnP related tasks as much as possible.
        
        New in this 0.6.4 - Pont Mirabeau - release
        
        * new MediaServer backends that allow access to
        * Picasa Web Albums (http://picasa.google.com)
        * a TestServer to easily serve and test interaction with
        * one or more items and adjust 'upnp_class', 'mimetype' and 'DLNA-flags',
        * items that are a GStreamer pipeline or an external program
        * a new - used in parallel - D-Bus API with an 'org.DLNA' interface
        with the goal to create a common API for all UPnP/DNLA frameworks
        * support for the dlna-playcontainer URI
        (http://netzflocken.de/2009/4/23/media-collection-playing-the-dlna-way)
        * enchancements to the GStreamer MediaRenderer, supporting now
        dlna-playcontainer and SetNextAVTransportURI, and jumping to previous
        and next tracks
        * support for video items served by Ampache (http://ampache.org)
        * base classes for a ScheduledRecording service
        * more 'compatibility' enhancements for different devices
        * and - as every time - the usual bugfixes and enhancements
        
        Kudos go to jmsizun, cjsmo, chewi, and lightyear.
